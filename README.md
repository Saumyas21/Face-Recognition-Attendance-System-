# Face-Recognition-Attendance-System-
## Introduction
Face recognition attendance systems are a rapidly growing technology that is being used across various industries, including education, healthcare, and security. These systems offer several advantages over traditional attendance systems such as fingerprint scanners and ID cards. Face recognition systems are contactless, which can help to reduce the spread of germs. Additionally, it is difficult to tamper with face recognition systems as it is not easy to forge a face.

## Problem identification-
One of the most significant obstacles I encountered while developing this system was achieving a high level of accuracy in the face recognition algorithm. Several factors could affect the algorithm's accuracy, such as lighting conditions, facial expressions, and head poses. Therefore, I had to experiment with various parameters and techniques to enhance the algorithm's accuracy as much as possible.
## Explanation-
•	Here's a clearer explanation of the modules used in the code:
face_recognition: This module implements various face recognition algorithms in Python, including the FaceNet algorithm.
•	cv2: This module presents a Python API for the OpenCV library, a well-known computer vision library.
•	NumPy: This module provides a Python interface to NumPy, a popular scientific computing library..
•	CSV: This module offers a Python interface for working with CSV (Comma Separated Values) files.
•	DateTime: This module provides a Python interface to the datetime object, which represents a date and time.

## Result-
The attendance system I developed uses facial recognition technology, ensuring accuracy, user-friendliness, and security. It has the potential to be utilized in various real-world scenarios.
